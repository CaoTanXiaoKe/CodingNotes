### Spark 背景

- [Spark的前世今生](http://v8.learn.oa.com/user/net?act_id=9249)

- **Data-Parallel Models**

Restrict the programming interface so that the system can do more automatically. 

"Here's an operation, run it on all of the data"
- I don't care where it runs(you schedule that).
- In fact, feel free to run it twice on different nodes.
- **Simlar to "declarative programming" in databases.**


### 安装
```shell
sudo yum update
